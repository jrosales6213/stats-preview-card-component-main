## My process
- First created the layout, html tags that I used were <main> and <section> to divide content. After I worked on css to create a responsive layout. 
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned about the mix-blend-mode to get the purple color opacity on the image. I got a little more familiar with positioning the image and margins. 

### Continued development
Continue to work on my flexbox skills, and image positioning. I had difficulty making the image cover the whole div when viewed on desktop mode. In my next project will try to do mobile first.
